# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have changed the way I handle reading and answering questions in many cases,
following a more iterable approach and aiming to always read the entire question first.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to bring paper to class so I can practice writing code without the beauty of PyCharm's auto complete. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Keeping up to date with what we are expected to know.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I tend to miss small parts of practicals on occasion so need to get the hang of double checking my work and my work's requirements. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I find that the programming subjects are clearly far more organised than my other
subjects due to your obvious passion for what you do. The other subjects are mostly unclear
in showing what is important and are generally not engaging, I would like to see better structured
practicals of subjects like database modelling where it feels like I am doing the same practical every week
and compared to this subject am not being taught in that process.
