# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At first, my estimates were inconsistent. I frequently underestimated how long a given task would take, especially when
it involved debugging or learning some new concept.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As time went on, I began to account for unknowns and pad my estimates with extra time. By the end of the course, my
estimates were far more realistic and reflective of the time actually taken.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to assess the complexity of a task by breaking it down into smaller pieces. This helped me find patterns in
areas where I underestimate, like edge case handling or integration of various components.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I unfortunately did not get reviewed on any of my pracs that I requested.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code showed me different ways to solve the same problem; it also showed me how important it is to
write clean and readable code that others can easily understand.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 07 code review for](https://github.com/LFeltham/cp1404practicals/pull/9) [@LFeltham](https://github.com/LFeltham)

### Explanation

This review was effective because it provided constructive and actionable feedback, focusing on improving code quality,
consistency, and adherence to best practices. Was also positive and supportive in the way my messages were worded.

### Did not receive a second code review request.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think I would incorporate diagrams or tables where appropriate to help students visualise concepts like
classes/inheritance diagrams. Especially for git to provide a visual workflow as it is a little hard to get your head
around.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I broke down the requirements into manageable steps; well-commented my code; I then tested my work through and through
to catch most of the bugs before submitting.
